# Python Hands-On Tasks â€“ Beginners

## Overview
The tasks focus on **basic Python programming skills** such as working with variables, lists, and dictionaries, and include user input handling, data updates, and simple conditional logic.  

Each task is presented as a real-life inspired exercise to help you connect programming concepts with practical applications.

These tasks emphasize:
- Variables and user input
- Basic arithmetic operations
- List creation and manipulation
- Dictionary creation and updates
- Conditional statements for decision making

---

## How to Use
Clone this project using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cohort-III-web2-Beginners/python-hands-on-5.git
```

Then:
```
cd python-hands-on-5/
```
Remove the original .git folder to create your own repository:
```
rm -rf .git/
```
Afterwards, create your own remote repository and push your code.


## Learning Objectives
By completing these tasks, you will:

- Understand how to collect and process user input
- Perform arithmetic operations with user-provided data
- Work with lists to store and manage multiple values
- Use dictionaries to represent structured data
- Update dictionary values programmatically
- Apply conditional logic to produce different outputs based on given rule
## Task Structure
- Each task is written as a separate Python file (task1.py, task2.py, etc.).
- Each file contains a docstring with the problem description, leaving space for you to write the solution.
- Tasks are meant to be solved sequentially to build on the skills from previous exercises.

## Prerequisites
Basic understanding of Python syntax
- Familiarity with variables, lists, and dictionaries
- Understanding of basic arithmetic and comparison operators
## What's Included
Simple input and output operations

- Basic list operations
- Dictionary creation, updates, and access
- Conditional statements (if, elif, else)

## How to Approach the Tasks
- Open each task file and read its docstring carefully.
- Think about the variables you need and the data types to use.
- Write your code step-by-step, testing after each part.
- Use print statements to verify your program works as expected.
- Complete each task before moving to the next.

## Python beginners
- Students learning programming fundamentals

## Pro Tips
- Always validate user input when possible.
- Test with different values, especially edge cases.
- Keep your code clean and readable.
- Think about the order of conditions to avoid logic errors.
